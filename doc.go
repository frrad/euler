/*
The "euler" package is a selection of tools that I've written to help me
solve Project Euler problems. They're mostly quite hacky, and some of them are
obsolete. In particular, I've duplicated some of the functionality of big.Int in
some places. I hope to phase this out at some point, but for now the priority is
that my old solutions continue to compile.
